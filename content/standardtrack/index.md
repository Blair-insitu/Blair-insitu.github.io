      title: Standard Track - **<span style="color:yellow;">CALL FOR ABSTRACTS IS LIVE</span>**
      text: |-
        Our standard track consists of an abstract review followed by submission of full length papers of **6 pages or less**. Here’s a quick guide showing how journal submissions (deadline has passed) relate to the standard track and what you need to do.

        | Situation | What to do |
        |-----------|------------|
        | **Submitted to journal track and accepted** | No abstract needed—the journal abstract will be reused, and you will get a presentation slot. |
        | **Submitted to journal track, not accepted but suitable for conference** | No abstract needed here, but if you want to present (oral or poster), you'll need to shorten your paper to the 6-page limit and submit as a full conference paper. |
        | **Submitted to journal track, not accepted and not suitable for conference** | Sorry, your paper cannot be presented. |
        | **Haven’t submitted anything yet and want to submit to standard track** | Please follow the instructions below. |
        | **Submitted to journal track but want to submit a separate standard track paper** | We appreciate your energy! Please follow the instructions below. |
        | **Submitting standard track, but want it considered for the journal** | Not possible—the journal deadline has passed. |
