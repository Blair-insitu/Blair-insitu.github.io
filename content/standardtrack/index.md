        There are two routes to submit you work to AUV2026. Journal track (deadline already past) and standard track. Papers accepted for either route can be presented at the conference.
        
        | Situation | What to do |
        |-----------|------------|
        | **Submitted to journal track and accepted** | No abstract needed—the journal abstract will be reused, and you will get a presentation slot. |
        | **Submitted to journal track, not accepted but suitable for conference** | No abstract needed here, but if you want to present (oral or poster), you'll need to shorten your paper to the 6-page limit and submit as a full conference paper. |
        | **Submitted to journal track, not accepted and not suitable for conference** | Sorry, your paper cannot be presented. |
        | **Haven’t submitted anything yet and want to submit to standard track** | Please follow the instructions below. |
        | **Submitted to journal track but want to submit a separate standard track paper** | We appreciate your energy! Please follow the instructions below. |
        | **Submitting standard track, but want it considered for the journal** | Not possible—the journal deadline has passed. |
