        AUV2026 has two tracks for submitting your contributions. Journal track (deadline already past) and standard track (submit abstracts via this page). Papers accepted via either route can be presented at the conference.
        
        | Situation | What to do |
        |-----------|------------|
        | **Submitted to journal track and accepted** | No abstract needed—the journal abstract will be reused, and you will get a presentation slot. |
        | **Submitted to journal track, not accepted but suitable for conference** | No abstract needed here, but if you want to present (oral or poster), you'll need to shorten your paper to the 6-page limit and submit as a full conference paper. |
        | **Submitted to journal track, not accepted and not suitable for conference** | Sorry, your paper cannot be presented. |
        | **Haven’t submitted anything yet and want to submit to standard track** | Please follow the instructions below. |
        | **Submitted to journal track but want to submit a separate standard track paper** | We appreciate your energy! Please follow the instructions below. |
        | **Submitting standard track, but want it considered for the journal** | Not possible—the journal deadline has passed. |
